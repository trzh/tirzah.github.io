								<h3>spring 2020 events calendar booklet</h3>
								<p>i designed a 16-page calendar & informational booklet for the events that UMBC's student events board planned to host throughout the spring 2020 semester. the pattern in the background was inspired by patterns from the early 2000s, because the booklet's theme was a throwback to 20 years ago in the spirit of entering a new decade. the design process took about two weeks, and involved working with two other executive board members who were in charge of scheduling the events for the semester. i created the background pattern in adobe illustrator, and laid out the pages in adobe indesign. over 1000 black & white booklets were printed and distributed across campus.</p>
