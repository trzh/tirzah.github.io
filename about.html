						<p>I'm a suburban Baltimore-based graphic designer & illustrator currently pushing pixels over at <a href = "http://www.analystnews.org">Analyst News</a>. Most recently, I worked as a designer for the Democratic Party. I graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I learned about how we can better equip people with technology that meets their needs and helps them feel seen & understood. I'm passionate about empowering underserved and underrepresented communities through beautiful design.</p>

						<h4>Jun 2021 to Nov 2022</h4>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-md-9">
						<p>As a part of the Mobilization team, I designed ads, emails, merch & social graphics that reached millions of people and raised hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Democrats up and down the ballot during the 2022 midterm elections. I pioneered new social media and email templates to deliver information in fresh and effective ways. My designs have appeared on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/CW1U9WUMkpS/">President Joe Biden's Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://flickr.com/photos/democrats/52355877298/in/photostream/">gotten signed</a> by him, and they've even <a href = "https://twitter.com/tirzuh/status/1493660604799848451">gotten roasted on FOX News</a> and <a href = "https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-national-committee-valentines-day">other conservative outlets</a>. I also worked closely with our team's intern to mentor and provide feedback to her.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>Through my internship with UMBC's <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/">Center for Democracy and Civic Life</a>, I built the <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/retrievertales">Retriever Tales</a> podcast, which highlights stories of UMBC community members past and present who worked to create change on campus. I conducted every interview and edited each episode myself in Audacity. I learned so much about what it means to empower people to be agents of change within their communities.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>I was invited by UMBC's Center for Democracy and Civic Life to join its delegation to the 2019 <a href = "https://imaginingamerica.org/">Imagining America</a> conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While I was there, I listened to lectures about decolonizing America, participated in a workshop that taught Wrong Theory Practice and was a part of a storytelling podcast where I talked about the identity struggle that comes with letting people mispronounce my name my entire life.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>During my second year of college, I attended <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/learning-engagement/strive/">STRiVE</a>, a five-day immersive leadership retreat aimed at helping student leaders discover their personal strengths and define their values. It equipped us with tools to create social change both on campus and out in the real world through intensive workshops and simulations. While I was there, I collaborated with ten other students to plan a hypothetical event highlighting the experiences and cultures of students with international backgrounds. I have returned twice as a speaker to answer questions about being a student leader.</p>
