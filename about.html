				<p>i'm an undergraduate student at the <b>university of maryland, baltimore county</b>, where i'm learning about how we can better equip people with technology that meets their needs and helps them feel seen & understood. i'm passionate about <b>empowering communities through beautiful design</b>, limiting my use of capital letters & using ampersands as much as i can &&&&&. </p>

				<p>when i'm not designing, i can be found making guacamole, stalking cool designers on <a href = "https://twitter.com/tirzuh">twitter</a>, singing along to <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/0xtIp0lgccN85GfGOekS5L?si=mURn6NiFQcOez8kuanUQDg">tame impala songs</a>, google maps-ing the <a href = "https://www.google.com/maps?q=kung+fu+tea+near+me&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwimmPaMlZvpAhWrhHIEHbRkCHUQ_AUoAXoECB8QAw">nearest bubble tea place</a> or rewatching <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42hhcH4VjE">brooklyn nine-nine</a>.</p>

						<h3>‚Äîdesigning @ <span style = "color:#000000">UMBC student events board</span></h3>
						<h4>april 2019 to present</h4>
						<p>i've designed flyers and other materials for over fifty events, from a glow-in-the-dark dodgeball night to trevor noah's homecoming comedy show. i've also worked with junior designers and non-designers to teach them the basics of adobe illustrator. starting this summer, i'll be taking over as the vice president of design for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>

					<div class = "experience">
						<h3>‚Äîorganizing @ <span style = "color:#000000">TEDxUMBC</span></h3>
						<h4>may 2019 to present</h4>
						<p>i partnered with three other undergrads to found and organize TEDxUMBC 2020: unmasking uncertainty. during this process, i've met with campus leadership to gain buy-in and form partnerships with groups and departments across campus. i've also conducted outreach with diverse student populations to recruit speakers and organizing committee members. our goal is to host this event in november 2020.</p>

					<div class = "experience">
						<h3>‚Äîdesigning @ <span style = "color:#000000">hackUMBC</span></h3>
						<h4>may 2019 to present</h4>
						<p>as part of the preparation for hackUMBC 2019, i worked with the rest of the design team and the marketing team over the summer to create visuals for our social media pages to promote our event and increase registration. in september, we hosted over 500 students from across the nation at our hackathon. and this year, i'm taking over as design team lead for hackUMBC 2020.</p>

					<div class = "experience">
						<h3>‚Äîlearning @ <span style = "color:#000000">imagining america 2019</span></h3>
						<h4>october 2019</h4>
						<p>as a junior, i was invited by UMBC's center for democracy and civic life to join its delegation to the 2019 imagining america conference in albuquerque, new mexico. while i was there, i participated in workshops that taught wrong theory practice, listened to lectures about decolonizing america and was a part of a storytelling podcast where i talked about the identity struggle that comes with letting people mispronounce my name my entire life (coming out soon!).</p>
					</div>
					<div class = "experience">
						<h3>‚Äîgrowing @ <span style = "color:#000000">STRiVE leadership for social impact retreat</span></h3>
						<h4>2019 co-hort</h4>
						<p>during my second year of college, i was nominated to attend a five-day immersive leadership retreat aimed at helping student leaders discover their personal strengths and define their values. it equipped us with tools to create social change both on campus and out in the real world through intensive workshops and simulations. while i was there, i collaborated with a group of ten other students to plan a hypothetical event that would highlight the experiences and cultures of students with international backgrounds. a year later, i returned as a speaker to answer questions about my experiences as a student leader at TEDxUMBC.</p>
