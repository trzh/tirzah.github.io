						<p>I'm a student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where I'm learning about how we can better equip people with technology that meets their needs and helps them feel seen & understood. I'm passionate about empowering underserved and underrepresented communities through beautiful design & using ampersands as much as I can &&&&&.</p>

							<h4>April 2019 to present</h4>
						</div>
						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>I've been a designer at <a href = "http://seb.umbc.edu/">(seb)</a> for nearly a year and a half, but in May 2020 I took over as Vice President of Design. In this role, I've had to completely reimagine how we approach design and student engagement because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, I implemented strategies to make our design more impactful, like developing monthly style guides.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>I partnered with three other undergrads to found and organize <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/tedxumbc/">TEDxUMBC 2020: Unmasking Uncertainty</a>. During this process, I met with campus leadership to gain buy-in and form partnerships with groups and departments across campus. I also conducted outreach with diverse student populations to recruit speakers and organizing committee members. We hosted this event virtually in November 2020 with ten incredible speakers from across campus.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>Through my internship with UMBC's <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/">Center for Democracy and Civic Life</a>, I've been working on building the Retriever Tales podcast, which highlights stories of UMBC community members past and present. I conduct every interview, and edit each episode myself in Audacity. I've spoken with current undergrads and grad students, alumni, faculty, staff and administration with the most fascinating stories, perspectives and experiences.</p>

						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>I was invited by UMBC's Center for Democracy and Civic Life to join its delegation to the 2019 <a href = "https://imaginingamerica.org/">Imagining America</a> conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While I was there, I listened to lectures about decolonizing America, participated in a workshop that taught Wrong Theory Practice and was a part of a storytelling podcast where I talked about the identity struggle that comes with letting people mispronounce my name my entire life (coming out soon!).</p>

							<h4>2019, 2020 & 2021</h4>
						</div>
						<div class = "col-md-9">
							<p>During my second year of college, I attended <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/learning-engagement/strive/">STRiVE</a>, a five-day immersive leadership retreat aimed at helping student leaders discover their personal strengths and define their values. It equipped us with tools to create social change both on campus and out in the real world through intensive workshops and simulations. While I was there, I collaborated with ten other students to plan a hypothetical event highlighting the experiences and cultures of students with international backgrounds. For the past two years, I have returned as a speaker to answer questions about campus leadership.</p>
