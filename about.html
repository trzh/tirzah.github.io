						<h2>Hi! Salaam! <span class="noto-sans-kr">안녕</span>! Salut!</h2>

						<h1>I'm Tirzah, or <span class="noto-nastaliq-urdu">ترزہ</span>, or <span class="noto-sans-hebrew">תִּרְצָה</span>.</h1>

						<p>I’m a designer passionate about the human-centered, mobility justice side of transportation and the built environment. My background is in illustration and graphic design, but I love learning how to use design in all its forms as a tool to pursue justice. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Urban Planning degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.</p>

						<p>When I’m not thinking about or learning about or practicing design, I can be found drinking black sesame lattes, tending to my ZZ plant Urbosa, learning ASL and Korean, perfecting my technique for folding dumplings, crocheting mittens for my friends, expanding my collection of metro cards from around the world, or attempting to train my cat Professor Kawkaba to fetch.</p>

						<p>Want to work with me? I'm already excited. <a href = "mailto:tirzahbk@gmail.com">Shoot me an email</a> and let's talk. At the moment, I'm most interested in freelance and part-time opportunities with a focus on community-centered design.</p>

						<h3>—designing @ <span style = "color:#000000; font-style:normal;">the Democratic Party</span></h3>
						<h4>Jun 2021 to Nov 2022</h4>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-md-9">
						<p>As a part of the Mobilization team, I designed ads, emails, merch & social graphics that reached millions of people and raised hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Democrats up and down the ballot during the 2022 midterm elections. I pioneered new social media and email templates to deliver information in fresh and effective ways. My designs have appeared on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/CW1U9WUMkpS/">President Joe Biden's Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://flickr.com/photos/democrats/52355877298/in/photostream/">gotten signed</a> by him, and they've even <a href = "https://twitter.com/tirzuh/status/1493660604799848451">gotten roasted on FOX News</a> and <a href = "https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-national-committee-valentines-day">other conservative outlets</a>. I also worked closely with our team's intern to mentor and provide feedback to her.</p>

						<h4>Aug 2020 to May 2021</h4>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-md-9">
						<p>Through my internship with UMBC's <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/">Center for Democracy and Civic Life</a>, I built the <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/retrievertales">Retriever Tales</a> podcast, which highlights stories of UMBC community members past and present who worked to create change on campus. I conducted every interview and edited each episode myself in Audacity. I learned so much about what it means to empower people to be agents of change within their communities.</p>

						<h4>Oct 2019</h4>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-md-9">
						<p>I was invited by UMBC's Center for Democracy and Civic Life to join its delegation to the 2019 <a href = "https://imaginingamerica.org/">Imagining America</a> conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. While I was there, I listened to lectures about decolonizing America, participated in a workshop that taught Wrong Theory Practice and was a part of a storytelling podcast where I talked about the identity struggle that comes with letting people mispronounce my name my entire life.</p>

						<h4>2019, 2020 & 2021</h4>
					</div>
					<div class = "col-md-9">
						<p>During my second year of college, I attended <a href = "https://civiclife.umbc.edu/learning-engagement/strive/">STRiVE</a>, a five-day immersive leadership retreat aimed at helping student leaders discover their personal strengths and define their values. It equipped us with tools to create social change both on campus and out in the real world through intensive workshops and simulations. While I was there, I collaborated with ten other students to plan a hypothetical event highlighting the experiences and cultures of students with international backgrounds. I have returned twice as a speaker to answer questions about being a student leader.</p>
